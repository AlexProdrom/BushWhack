# BushWhack
**Version: 1.0**

BushWhack started as a simple school project but during the development we found Android programming pretty cool & fun so... we decided to go further!

## Installation

The app can be downloaded using the link to the signed apk!

[BushWhack.apk]()

## Guidelines
Create an account or log in with your email and manage your trails. You will also be able to upload a profile picture but only in the next versions. 

Besides that, now the rest depends on you: create a new trail, save the just created trail, continue an already existing trail, delete a trail or complete one!

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request ;)

## History

The project is still at its first version but new features are going to be added soon hopefully! (upload profile picture, better GUI, etc)

## Credits

The project was realized with the help and support of our Android teacher.
